## Agenda
**Build Agenda** - Each person will be asked if they have any agenda items. The Facilitator needs only a few words and will list the items on a document for all to see.

## PROCESS EACH AGENDA ITEM

1. **Agenda Item Owner Present Proposal** - Proposer only, or a brief discussion to get to a proposal going if needed.
2. **Clarifying Questions to Proposal** - Anyone asks, proposer answers. Repeat. Try to understand, not influence.
3. **Reaction Round** - Everyone speaks, one at a time, except proposer. No discussion. Facilitator will rotate through each person. No reaction is a valid response.
4. **Proposer to Amend & Clarify** - Proposer only, can optionally clarify intent, or amend proposal.
5. **Objections** - Facilitator asks, “Do you see a reason why adopting this proposal causes harm or moves us backwards? Objection or no objection?”
	**If No Objections** the proposal is adopted and moved to product backlog for prioritization and eventual implementation as capacity allows.
	**If Yes Objections**, One Objection at a time. Objections are stated, tested, and captured one at a time without discussion. The goal is to craft an amended proposal that would not cause the Objection, but still addresses the proposer’s tension.
8. **Repeat Objection Round Until** no valid objections are raised

## Rules for Valid Objections

- Would this cause harm?
- Would this stop someone else from deliving?
- Would this set us back?
- Would this be too risky? A little is fine and good. Too much is not.

## CLOSE MEETING
Reflection and insight about the meeting - Each person briefly shares anything they deem pertinent, no discussion, the facilitator will officially close the meeting and end the conference.
