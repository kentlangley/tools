# Core Team Meeting Guidance
The core team meeting is designed. It's not an accident. It is tightly facilitated.

The meeting will be facilitated by one of the team members. Facilitation is a learned skill and should be shifted from team member to team member over time.

## Meeting Objective
* Clarity for the team about each others project and cross-departmental / experimental updates when required.
* A chance to speak up for any member of the team without question or fear of reproach.

## Meeting Agenda & Process
| Time | Section  | Description |
|:--|:--|:--|
| 1 - 5m | Check-In | Get Present. Spend 1-2 minutes in reflection of current thoughts, feelings, moods.|
| 6 - 35m | Project Updates | Each Person, one at a time, updates the team on their projects. The facilitator will kick things off. Each person will give their updates, ask if there are any questions, when there are no more clarifying questions, they will pick someone else to update next. |
