# Core Team Meeting Guidance
The core team meeting is designed. It's not an accident. It is tightly facilitated.

The meeting will be facilitated by one of the team members. Facilitation is a learned skill and should be shifted from team member to team member over time.

## Meeting Objective
* Clarity for the team about each others project and cross-departmental / experimental updates when required.
* A chance to speak up for any member of the team without question or fear of reproach.

## Meeting Agenda & Process
| Time | Section  | Description |
|:--|:--|:--|
| 1 - 5m | Check-In | Say something nice about the weather|
| 6 - 35m | Project Updates | Each Person, one at a time, updates the team on their projects. The facilitator will kick things off. Each person will give their updates, ask if there are any questions, when there are no more clarifying questions, they will pick someone else to update next. |
| 36 + m | Dynamic Agenda | Each person logs, in 3-4 words per item, each item they wish to move forward. Facilitator works through the list in the most efficient manner possible to to exactly one thing. Get to the next best possible step for that task to resolve it for the person raising the items to THEIR satisfaction. |

## Key Meeting Results
